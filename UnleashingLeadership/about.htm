      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We are all first and foremost leaders of ourselves.&nbsp; How would your 
        organization perform if everyone accepted leadership responsibility?&nbsp; 
        How differently would your organization behave if leadership were an expectation 
        of everyone, not an exception for the anointed few? &nbsp;The most distinguishing 
        characteristic between thriving organizations and struggling organizations 
        is the presence and quality of leadership at all levels.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You'll be happy to know that you have all the leadership potential needed 
        in your organization right now to increase performance, productivity, 
        and profits' and to sustain the increases.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the vast 
        majority of your organization's leadership potential is probably locked 
        up behind the bars of bureaucracy or staggering under the weight of organizational 
        inertia.&nbsp; This doesn't happen by chance.&nbsp; The cultural dragon 
        you're fighting feeds on old school notions about leadership that grew 
        out of a Napoleonic, hierarchical military organizational model.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Hierarchical organizations are typically run by&amp;#8230;well&amp;#8230;little 
        Napoleons; especially at mid-organization level.&nbsp; They're cute, especially 
        the way they prop their hands under the lapel of their sport coats; but 
        they're not good leaders for the 21st Century.&nbsp; It's not their fault.&nbsp; 
        The old leadership school taught that an organization is made up of officers 
        and enlistees; the more powerful and the less powerful; superiors and 
        subordinates.&nbsp; A hierarchical organizational design draws leadership 
        focus and energy away from problem solving and progressive thinking by 
        encouraging those climbing the organizational food chain to focus instead 
        on protecting their positions, perks, and territory.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Leadership is a circle not a ladder.&nbsp; Inverting this traditional 
        pyramid of institutionalized defensiveness and territoriality requires 
        a premeditated, purposeful, intentional, and methodical leadership system 
        that aligns what people do best with what organizations need most.&nbsp; 
        The ComposiTeam&amp;#8482; Leadership System is designed to do exactly 
        that, and finishes what the movement for flattened organizations, shared 
        responsibility, and distributed leadership responsibility started.&nbsp; 
        It does all this with remarkably sophisticated three-step, simplicity:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> 1. Create a database that identifies the leadership styles and motivations 
        of everyone in your organization. 2. Profile the jobs, tasks, projects, 
        objectives, and initiatives your organization needs executed. 3. Match 
        the composite leadership profile of a leadership team to the initiative 
        profile.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>With that, the stage is set to focus everyone's unique talents and abilities 
        on making your organization thrive as never before.&nbsp; Not by luck; 
        nor chance; nor edict from on high; but from a well-designed and engineered 
        leadership system that ties everyone in your organization to the truth 
        of the past, the irreplaceability of the moment, and the promise of the 
        future.&nbsp; Without these things, much in the way of time, energy, and 
        resources will be wasted in an effort that might take you someplace you 
        had no intention of going, at a price you had no intention of paying, 
        and with more unintended than intended consequences.&nbsp; An intentional, 
        methodical, well engineered leadership system is your best hope for taming 
        your organizational dragon.</p>
