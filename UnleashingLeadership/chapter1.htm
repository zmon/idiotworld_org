      <h1 >Chapter 1</h1>
      <P ><I>Puff</I> <I>the Magic Dragon,</I> is a familiar song to all of us. 
        The character, Puff, is even familiar to our children and grandchildren. 
        Yet, how many of us have asked the burning question: What happened <I>after</I> 
        &#8220; Jackie Paper came no more?&#8221;</P>
      <P> After Jackie dumped Puff for &#8220;other toys,&#8221; we heard how 
        Puff's &#8220;head was bent in sorrow;&#8221; how &#8220;green scales 
        fell like rain,&#8221; how Puff &#8220;no longer went to play along that 
        cherry lane,&#8221; how &#8220;Puff could not be brave,&#8221; and &#8220;sadly 
        slipped into his cave.&#8221; But, &#8220;dragons live forever,&#8221; 
        remember? So, the story didn't end there.</P>
      <P >Jackie grew up, earned an MBA, and became an executive, too busy for 
        childish things&mdash;like dragons, enjoying life, and making work and 
        play as enjoyable as possible for his customers and team members. Puff, 
        meanwhile, stewed and ruminated in his cave. His sorrow turned to anger, 
        his anger to resentment, and, before long, the dragon's thoughts 
        turned to revenge. It was <I>get-even</I> time for Puff.</P>
      <P >Puff didn't spend all of his time in the cave moping around. He 
        surfed the Internet, researching what makes organizations thrive, so he 
        could make sure they wouldn't. Puff emerged from the cave on a mission 
        to destroy organizations whose executives have forgotten how to have fun, 
        create happy customers, and develop enthusiastic team members. Having 
        heard that &#8220;you are what you eat,&#8221; he changed the name on 
        his driver's license to <I>Org.</I> </P>
      <P> Using his magical powers, Org became a ubiquitous creature, and now 
        resides in the custodial closets of every organization in the Western 
        World. As a nocturnal reptile, Org sleeps all day, invisible and virtually 
        undetectable; except for the snoring that everybody acts like they <I>don't</I> 
        hear. He ventures out at night, when the office hallways are dark and 
        empty. People who work flex time into the wee hours to avoid the office 
        idiot, and hear those strange &#8220;after midnight&#8221; noises, know 
        they're not alone.</P>
      <H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">A 
        well-fed dragon</FONT></FONT></H3>
      <P >Although not every dragon's diet is made up of organizational 
        leadership's best intentions, Org's is. Org's Web research 
        revealed that, among other successful characteristics, the highest performing 
        organizations tend to make leadership everybody's business. The 
        best companies believe that a leadership attitude should be an expectation 
        of everyone, not an exception for a few. In the most productive and profitable 
        enterprises, leadership responsibility is distributed and shared as much 
        as possible across the organization, not merely used as a way to control 
        labor and predict profits. It was clear to Org that, to slow down progress 
        in organizations, to reduce their effectiveness and efficiency, and to 
        make them resistant to change, he needed to keep the leadership potential 
        of team members bottled up.</P>
      <P >Org's research also taught him that change is inevitable, and 
        the most successful organizations remain flexible, anticipate change, 
        plan for it, and use it to their advantage. They proactively adjust to 
        fluctuations in the internal and external marketplace. By making leadership 
        part of everyone's daily responsibilities, organizations are able 
        to stay on the leading edge of change, and respond to it in real time. 
      </P>
      <P >To accomplish these things, organizations invest billions (with a capital 
        &#8220;B&#8221;) on change initiatives, continuous process improvements, 
        new leadership skills, and a wide variety of training and development 
        programs intended to improve personal and/or organizational performance. 
        It was an acquired taste, but Org developed an appetite for gobbling up 
        change initiatives, continuous process improvements, new leadership skills, 
        and any type of training and development program that threatened to improve 
        personal and/or organizational performance. </P>
      <P >Initiatives intended to achieve mastery and excellence, have become 
        the staples of Org's diet as he roams your darkened offices all 
        night. Just before dawn, a bloated dragon waddles back to the custodial 
        closet, curls up, belches, and goes back to sleep.</P>
      <P >The next morning, the change management initiative has been replaced 
        with organizational inertia, continuous process improvement has become 
        a continuous meeting, supervisors, managers, and executives are flying 
        by the seat of their pants and skirts again, customer service is as much 
        an oxymoron as ever, internal customers aren't communicating effectively 
        with each other&mdash;much less with anyone outside the organization&mdash;and 
        the last time an incoming call was answered by a live voice was sometime 
        in the second quarter of 1996. In short, the organization has become more 
        user-<I>unfriendly</I> than ever<I>.</I> Bad dragon.</P>
      <H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Got 
        corporate culture?</FONT></FONT></H2>
      <P CLASS="western"><BR>
      </P>
      <P> The simple answer is, &#8220;yes.&#8221; The complex answer is, &#8220;more 
        than you know.&#8221; Whether you like it or not, any time two or more 
        people get together to do anything, a culture emerges. Most people think 
        corporate culture is the collective, underlying, mostly unspoken, beliefs, 
        values, paradigms, etc., that James Belasco, Warren Bennis, Jim Collins, 
        Stephen Covey, Peter F. Drucker, Gareth Morgan, Peter Senge, Margaret 
        Wheatley, and others taught us about during the last quarter of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> 
        Century.</P>
      <P> We agree. But, what they call corporate culture, we call <I>Org, the 
        Organizational Dragon.</I> If you try to initiate or, harder yet, <I>sustain</I> 
        change that runs contrary to your organization's culture, the change 
        will last only until Org gets the munchies. It doesn't matter how 
        much you pay consultants, or how energetic and enlightened the training 
        program is, attempts at change will wind up in Org's digestive tract. 
        It won't help to merely throw money at your culture, go through 
        the training and development motions, find nothing but crumbs the next 
        morning, stand with your head thrown back, shake your fists in the air, 
        and scream, <I>&#8220;Org!&#8221;</I> He's a sound sleeper. </P>
      <P >What do we mean by change? Try a 10 percent increase in profits, or 
        cost savings. That's change. How about reducing turnover and intellectual 
        capital leakage? That's change, too. Anything that produces improvement 
        or digression from where you are at the moment is change. Any attempt 
        you make to change your organization, its performance, or outcomes will 
        be, by design, positive. Now, if we can only get things to consistently 
        work the way we design them. As any business professional knows, sometimes 
        they do, often, they don't. </P>
      <H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Got 
        a cynical corporate culture?</FONT></FONT></H3>
      <P CLASS="western"><BR>
      </P>
      <P >Do some change initiatives work splendidly? Sure they do. Are there 
        great training and development programs out there? Of course. Do many 
        organizational change initiatives last over time? Indeed. Is there terrific 
        leadership in many organizations? Without question. Why are you reading 
        this book? Probably because you can't answer, &#8220;yes,&#8221; 
        to the last four questions about <I>your</I> company with a straight face, 
        <I>or,</I> you have one of those super, high-performance organizations 
        constantly looking to get <I>even better.</I> </P>
      <P><B> </B>Everybody involved in leading change begins at a real disadvantage. 
        Org's going to wake up tonight with a growling tummy. Every change 
        initiative, continuous process improvement, new leadership skill, customer 
        service training, internal/external communication initiative, and O.S.H.A. 
        compliance seminar that team members are exposed to or participate in&mdash;that 
        their immediate bosses ignore, <I>don't</I> participate in, and/or 
        simply don't support&mdash;is a recipe for dragon delight.</P>
      <P >Many people in leadership positions consider their job done when they 
        send their people to be trained. They don't understand that their 
        job as leaders is only beginning, in fact, it's never done. When 
        a change initiative is undertaken, only to be abandoned later, people 
        don't become <I>more</I> eager to embrace the next one. When people's 
        hopes and expectations are built up only to be demolished, they become 
        a lot harder to motivate the next time, and the time after that. Cynicism 
        builds cumulatively, like a callous. </P>
      <P >The thicker defensive skin builds up over time, the more difficult it 
        is to penetrate. We're consultants. We know what it is to be introduced 
        to a room full of middle managers, or executives, as &#8220;the guys who 
        are going to change things around here.&#8221; Right. Where's that 
        loud snoring coming from? The custodial closet? Who could that be? Org 
        is alive and well in the sallow complexions and vacant glances we get 
        from the managers and/or executives. After an endless stream of consultants 
        and change management initiatives, they have become zombies; the living 
        dead. </P>
      <P >We don't blame them. How would you like to be a square peg being 
        pounded through a round hole? Classical management theory would have us 
        believe that the fastest way to get a square peg through a round hole 
        is to use a bigger hammer. Time is money, after all. Long-time middle 
        managers can be easily identified by their flattened heads. New hires 
        still have rounded domes. </P>
      <H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Why 
        is Org cynical?</FONT></FONT></H3>
      <P CLASS="western"><BR>
      </P>
      <P> Org is cynical because he assumed Jackie Paper would keep frolicking 
        forever. Jackie didn't, and Org got ticked. People in organizations 
        get ticked and become increasingly cynical every time a new change initiative, 
        continuous process improvement, leadership development program, customer 
        service seminar, internal and/or external communication initiative is 
        brought in; and nothing improves. </P>
      <P >Whose fault is that? Bosses blame unmotivated team members. Team members 
        say it's their idiot bosses. We know where to place the blame because 
        we work with unmotivated team members <I>and</I> idiot bosses. We've 
        <I>been</I> unmotivated team members <I>and</I> idiot bosses. We've 
        played the role of oppressor and the oppressed at different times in our 
        careers. We also assumed, like Org, that the people we relied upon would 
        never fail us. But, it happens. Some learn to get over it. Some, like 
        Org, get even. We loaded up our wagons with questions and set out looking 
        for answers.</P>
      <P >When we slip into our collective worst selves&mdash;uninspired, defensive, 
        and selfish&mdash;cynicism becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. Then we 
        all share the blame for our own cynicism and the loss in personal and 
        organizational performance. Clinging to unrealistic expectations, we can 
        become our own worst enemies. </P>
      <P> The temptation to become cynical and leave our motivation in the parking 
        lot is understandable, but we know it doesn't have to be that way, 
        no matter how much the organization stumbles over its own feet. It ultimately 
        boils down to personal choice, and saying, &#8220;No,&#8221; to cynicism 
        and negativity. When you do, the first one to benefit is you. A more pro-actively 
        motivated organization will follow. </P>
      <P> It takes a new skill set to be sure. Such personal and organizational 
        improvements call for a new paradigm. If this sounds complicated, difficult, 
        or bothersome, remind yourself that, a few minutes ago, you didn't 
        even know you had a dragon living in your custodial closet. See how your 
        thinking has changed already?</P>
      <H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Good 
        and bad luck</FONT></FONT></H3>
      <P ><BR>
      </P>
      <P > Don't be fooled by thinking luck is the same thing as successful 
        change. Many executives, us included, have benefited from upswings in 
        the market, unexpected shifts in customer demands (in our favor), fortuitous 
        timing, and luck of the draw. Of course, we called it brilliant executive 
        leadership at the time. We didn't worry about the dragon in the 
        custodial closet because he couldn't eat enough to keep up with 
        and overcome our run of good luck. At times, we succeeded in spite of 
        Org&mdash;until he caught up with us. Dragon's not only live forever, 
        they <I>eat</I> forever, and luck eventually turns.</P>
      <P >What happens when business is off? Is it because leadership has lost 
        its edge? Are supervisors, managers, or executives, being exposed as phonies 
        whose luck has run out? People don't learn much about themselves 
        or others while they're succeeding in spite of poor practices. When 
        the real outcomes reflect the real work being done, the real learning 
        begins. </P>
      <P >Org knows when organizations are living in a fool's paradise, 
        and just keeps eating. When earnings tank, have you ever noticed how productivity 
        and morale seem to have found their way into the tank first? Most executives 
        bring in a consultant or a new training program for course correction 
        <I>after</I> they've steered the ship into an iceberg. </P>
      <P >Why are they suddenly concerned with efficiency, productivity, and performance 
        issues they didn't give a second thought to when customers were 
        beating down their doors and throwing money at them? Efficiency, productivity, 
        and performance should <I>always</I> be priorities, through good times 
        and bad. Everybody experiences bad times. You don't need to be visited 
        by three ghosts, like Ebenezer Scrooge, to expect downturns now and then.</P>
      <P >Org loves organizational policy makers who act shocked and surprised 
        when fortunes turn, because they're the most likely to shoot from 
        the hip. Imagine executives cramming hastily acquired training programs 
        and consultants down the barrel of an antique canon, pointing it at the 
        problem, and lighting the fuse. The &#8220;boom&#8221; is loud and impressive. 
        Although the cloud of smoke is majestic, it masks the fact that nothing 
        hit the target; at least until it clears. By that time, the executives 
        are off to blow up something else, leaving behind piles of dragon food.</P>
      <H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Substance 
        abuse</FONT></FONT></H3>
      <P ><BR>
      </P>
      <P >The same organizational cultural faux pas applies to hiring and keeping 
        talented and knowledgeable people. We define substance abuse as throwing 
        away substance in favor of a better-looking wrapper. Running off experienced 
        people for cheaper labor makes as much sense as peeling a banana, throwing 
        the fruit away, and eating the peel. It takes patience, persistence, and 
        perseverance to make the most of what we already have going for us, especially 
        if the wrapper is worn and tattered. Nevertheless, the financial and stability 
        benefits that flow from better use of available human resources have been 
        proven time and time again. It requires forming a coalition of the willing&mdash;dragons 
        and team members alike. And so it comes back to culture.</P>
      <P >Too often, executive leadership looks at people as digits on a profit 
        and loss statement, or &#8220;overhead&#8221; on a cash flow analysis. 
        Have you ever heard anyone come right out and suggest, &#8220;Let's 
        dump all those older men and women who know our business, our products, 
        our customers, and the marketplace inside and out. We can replace them 
        with kids who don't know squat, but will work twice the hours at 
        half the pay.&#8221; </P>
      <P >We haven't heard anyone say that either&hellip;<I>aloud.</I> But, 
        that's the message echoing down many corporate hallways. What we 
        <I>are</I> used to hearing in executive sessions is, &#8220;Retirement 
        costs are skyrocketing. Labor and benefit costs need to be reduced substantially 
        if we expect to show strong earnings on The Street.&#8221; Then sinister 
        solutions seem to formulate in the shadows until HR announces the latest 
        &#8220;downsizing,&#8221; &#8220;re-sizing,&#8221; or &#8220;right-sizing.&#8221; 
        The dirty little secret most executives refuse to acknowledge is that 
        the <I>real</I> cost in intellectual capital, the expense of training 
        new-hires, and the productivity ramp up will eventually deflate earnings 
        on The Street and another frenetic fire drill will begin. </P>
      <P >Frenetic fire drills are attempts to stabilize organizations destabilized 
        by &#8220;downsizing,&#8221; &#8220;re-sizing,&#8221; &#8220;right-sizing,&#8221; 
        or &#8220;reductions in force.&#8221; Expenditures on consultants and 
        new training and development initiatives contribute to the cost of these 
        fire drills until the cost of &#8220;downsizing,&#8221; &#8220;re-sizing,&#8221; 
        or &#8220;right-sizing&#8221; eclipses what it would have cost to unleash 
        the pent up leadership already inside the organization. Now you know why 
        consultants have a reputation for pulling the fire alarm in your headquarters 
        building. But, we don't want to give away too many of our trade 
        secrets. Org has to eat.</P>
      <P >The substance abuse issue of sending away older, more experienced people 
        in favor of younger ones is often not about money at all. When the veterans 
        have become alienated by conflicting and/or disappointing company policies 
        over time, the &#8220;new blood&#8221; is often an attempt to bring in 
        fresh, untainted attitudes. Of course, the same inconsistent policies 
        and lack of follow through that turned the veterans cynical to begin with 
        will have the same effect on the newcomers. Just give them time. Org is 
        a patient dragon. </P>
      <P >What ever happened to boosting earnings by getting more out of the intellectual 
        resources currently available? Sending intellectual capital out the door 
        with a gold watch, a hail, and hardy farewell just makes Org's foraging 
        for food easier. With all of that valuable knowledge and skill heading 
        for Florida or Arizona, training and development efforts must be stepped 
        up for the new kids on the block. Org says, &#8220;Bring it on.&#8221;</P>
      <H3 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Changing 
        culture</FONT></FONT></H3>
      <P CLASS="western"><BR>
      </P>
      <P> If the desired culture is inconsistent with the real culture, Org will 
        continue to snarf up the desired culture every night, belch, and go back 
        to sleep. Organizational executives will scratch their scalps until they're 
        bald, or scream until they're hoarse, and Org will snore. Team members 
        will mutter under their breath, &#8220;Another training and development 
        program mysteriously disappears, never to be heard from again. Remind 
        me to take a personal day when it's time to start another one.&#8221; 
      </P>
      <P >The only organizations able to successfully defy this cultural consistency 
        challenge are those that have managed to actually <I>change</I> their 
        corporate culture, or <I>align</I> their desired culture with their existing 
        culture. Changing a culture&mdash;<I>really</I> changing it, not just 
        redecorating the old one and pronouncing it changed&mdash;requires taming 
        your dragon and making him a part of your team. To align a desired culture 
        with an existing culture requires at least learning to coexist with your 
        dragon. Both approaches can work. Sometimes the best solution is a combination 
        of both.</P>

      <P >We would never suggest anything so cruel as to starve Org by cutting 
        off his food supply. Yet, that's what happens when you make change,

        organizational performance&mdash;must be <I>personalized</I> if they're 
        to be <I>internalized.</I> They become internalized only when people believe 
        and buy into the knowledge and information presented to them. Improved 
        efficiency, productivity, and performance, necessary for increased profitability, 
        all require adjustments and adaptations from you <I>and</I> your team 
        members.</P>
      <P >When new knowledge and skill sets are internalized, Org can't 
        eat them. People don't leave internalized knowledge and skill sets 
        lying around the office when they go home. Because they've been 
        internalized, new knowledge and skill sets are carried in the hearts and 
        minds of the learners wherever they go. That's where real organizational 
        culture exists&mdash;in the hearts and minds of the organizational population. 
        Org can't eat what's carried inside a person's heart 
        and mind.</P>
      <P >If you, as a policy maker, haven't invested in developing and 
        consistently supporting your people, what they believe about you in their 
        hearts and minds can be counterproductive. &#8220;It doesn't matter 
        if they feel good about the organization and their role in it,&#8221; 
        you might say. &#8220;I don't pay people to feel good.&#8221; We 
        know you'd never say anything so short-sighted. But, some do, in 
        spite of the fact that organizational performance, productivity, and profitability 
        depend more on the emotional investment people have in meeting organizational 
        objectives than any other factor.</P>
      <P >What you want your people to carry in their heats and minds are positive, 
        pro-active intentions about your organizational mission and agenda. That 
        way, they'll leave the useless, irrelevant, negative junk behind 
        when they go home at night. When the real culture is as positive as the 
        <I>desired</I> culture, all that's left for Org to eat is the stuff 
        you don't want contaminating your organizations. Faced with going 
        hungry, Org will eat what he can get; this time doing us a big favor in 
        the process. He's a dragon on a mission, but when it's time 
        to eat, it's time to eat. After all, <I>voracious</I> is Org's 
        middle name.</P>
      <P >Organizations are voracious, too. People participate fully, with the 
        best they have, when they feel necessary to the outcome. People want to 
        participate, but only if they'll feel good about what they're 
        doing. They're hungry for encouragement, growth, and a sense of 
        ownership. Either feed your organizational population stuff they can put 
        to good use or they'll eat <I>you.</I></P>

      </P>
      <P >Many people reading this book have struggled long and hard to get their 
        dragons working on the same page as organizational leadership, and our 
        hats go off to them. Many of those same people are organizational designers 
        and appreciate how Napoleonic, military-style, hierarchical organizational 
        structures make it practically impossible to change anything, much less 
        organizational culture. Org is particularly fond of hierarchical organization 
        charts. They're like a road map to dinner. </P>
      <P >Traditional hierarchies make foraging for dragon food easier. When leaders 
        are separate and definitely not equal, they tend to become ensconced in 
        corner offices, or at least offices with windows. All Org needs to do 
        to find a rich diet of discarded change initiatives, customer service, 
        diversity, or communications training, is work the interior of the building, 
        away from corner offices and windows. </P>
      <P> Classic, Napoleonic, hierarchical organization charts look good on paper, 
        but rarely translate into efficient work practices. They are, in fact, 
        one of those designs that really don't work as designed. The biggest 
        problem is that human beings are just too, well, <I>human.</I> As a result, 
        traditional organizational charts tend to institutionalize inefficiency, 
        and misalignment of natural talents to job descriptions.</P>
      <H3 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Silos 
        and subversion</FONT></FONT></H3>
      <P CLASS="western"><BR>
      </P>
      <P >The only thing silos are good for is storing grain or intercontinental 
        ballistic missiles in North Dakota. As Dr. John and Dr. Angelo help companies 
        distribute leadership responsibility throughout their organizational populations, 
        we also help them rethink their traditional concepts of hierarchy. We 
        sometimes refer to the time-honored organization chart as the <I>money 
        </I>chart, because, more than anything else, it maps who gets paid the 
        most. In terms of form and function (i.e. getting things done), the traditional 
        money chart doesn't account for the many techniques people have 
        devised to subvert it. </P>
      <P >People in intermediate organizational positions quickly learn how they 
        can influence decisions at the top by filtering information as it makes 
        its way up the ladder and back down again. If top executives are making 
        decisions based on heavily censored information, they are not as powerful 
        as they think they are. Neither are they as effective as they could be 
        if they received clear and complete data and an uninterrupted way to communicate 
        unfiltered information back to the worker bees.</P>
      <P> Another hidden problem with the traditional money chart is the <I>silo 
        effect.</I> Department heads zealously protect their dominance over the 
        column of names beneath their own. If someone in Ralph's silo wants 
        to contact or work with someone in Helen's silo&mdash;not necessarily 
        for betting in the office football pool or debriefing weekend reruns of 
        <I>Trading Spaces</I> on Monday morning&mdash;there are immediate political 
        implications. When it comes to taking initiative and forming strategic 
        alliances to get things done, one must first honor the silo and go through 
        channels; if one goes by the book, that is.</P>
      <P> Going through channels means seeking permission from those above you. 
        Then, (if they're helping you) they do the same; and so on until 
        your request reaches the top of your silo. Then Ralph contacts Helen (maybe) 
        and the request starts working its way down her silo to the person you 
        wanted to deal with in the first place. Everyone's played the party 
        game where you whisper something in a person's ear and that person 
        whispers the information to the next person, etc, until it comes full-circle 
        back to you. By then, the information has significantly changed simply 
        by the way it is repeated over and over. Imagine how much more distortion 
        there will be if the information is screened each time based on each person's 
        political agenda.</P>
      <P> The traditional organization chart, with its well-defended silos, is 
        a major contributor to organizational inertia. When the number one priority 
        for supervisors, managers, and executives becomes protecting their territory, 
        is it any wonder that efforts to shake it up and change things are fed 
        to the dragon almost as fast as they arrive? Thus, organizations with 
        traditional, Napoleonic, military-style hierarchies tend to remain static. 
        To loosely paraphrase Sir Isaac Newton's <I>Law of Inertia,</I> 
        organizations at rest tend to stay at rest. Fortunately, organizations 
        in motion will tend to stay in motion, as long as you keep doing the things 
        that got you moving in the first place. </P>
      <H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>An 
        end to isolation</FONT></FONT></H3>
      <P CLASS="western"><BR>
      </P>
      <P >Ideally, in organizational life, no one works in isolation. Unfortunately, 
        cynicism and lack of meaningful engagement often result in people withdrawing 
        into their own safe spaces. The organizational money chart enables people 
        to isolate because they can always point upward when someone asks, &#8220;Who's 
        in charge?&#8221; which is another way of asking, &#8220;Who's responsible?&#8221; 
        which is another way of asking, &#8220;Whose fault is it?&#8221; which 
        is another way of asking, &#8220;Who's going to take the fall?&#8221; 
        The one taking the fall is usually <I>not</I> the person who is truly 
        at fault, and, over time, the motivation to do well dwindles. It's 
        hard enough keeping attitudes and motivation high without throwing structural 
        roadblocks, like hierarchical organization charts, in the way.</P>
      <P >Behavior and relationship expectations in most organizations are based 
        upon the organizational money chart, which illustrates who makes the most 
        mullahs and has the best benefits. But, a dollar paid to a line worker 
        or a computer programmer is worth the same as a dollar paid to and executive 
        vice-president. The executive vice-president merely gets paid more of 
        them. This makes sense as long as the executive vice president is contributing 
        proportionately more to the organization's earnings. </P>
      <P >This is the theory behind most compensation schemes and organization 
        charts. As the playing field becomes increasingly leveled and leadership 
        responsibility is distributed based on natural ability and inclination 
        to shoulder responsibility, as we're going to show, the compensation 
        scheme must adjust accordingly. If compensation is merely tied to the 
        organizational money chart, the real contributions of many in the organization 
        are not being recognized or rewarded. Such neglect kills enthusiasm and 
        effort.</P>
      <H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Rings 
        of responsibility</FONT></FONT></H3>
      <P CLASS="western"><BR>
      </P>
      <P> Unless the autocracy has absolute power to punish or imprison subordinates, 
        hierarchical, militaristic-style leadership models seldom produce genuine 
        high performance. When in doubt, we offer a three-word reminder: Former 
        Soviet Union. A more realistic and functional way to think of leadership 
        responsibility in organizations is concentric rings. At the core are individuals 
        who are encouraged to take leadership responsibility for themselves and 
        their specific tasks. </P>
      <P >Moving outward are rings of increased responsibility that tend to become 
        more complex as you move farther from the core. The more area contained 
        within a ring, the higher the demand for effective leadership performance, 
        and the more responsibility assigned to the leader. Although everyone 
        is expected to accept collaborative leadership responsibility for all 
        they are able and qualified to lead, they must also respect the ringleaders.</P>
      <P> Within each ring, people should be allowed to move freely without regard 
        for political boundaries or territoriality. One of the things ringleaders 
        encourage is the uncensored free-flow of information and ideas, both within 
        their circles and within the biggest circle of all, the one drawn around 
        the entire organization. Think of a leader orbiting around a single team 
        as a <I>team leader.</I> Responsibility for several teams is given to 
        a <I>group leader.</I> Responsibility for several groups is give to an 
        <I>area leader.</I> And so on. The specific language you associate with 
        the position needs to reflect the organizational function, so as to reinforce 
        the nature of the relationships. (If you insist on keeping your silos, 
        then at least be honest and call department heads, &#8220;silo lids.&#8221;)</P>
      <P >Each ring, regardless of its size, represents a cell that is formed 
        around initiatives the organization needs executed to achieve the organization's 
        overall strategic goals and objectives. That's a whole lot different 
        than merely saying that Frank is the vice president of Marketing, which 
        means Frank sits atop the Marketing silo. If Frank is orbiting around 
        a marketing cell, formed around a specific purpose, Frank's earning 
        his money. Sitting on top of the silo, he might be or he might not be. 
        One thing is for sure, sitting on top of the silo, Frank's not moving 
        very fast, and any effort exerted by Frank, or his staff, is a sitting 
        duck for Org, the dragon. </P>

      </P>
      <P >Think of your organization as a molecule instead of a field of silos. 
        Silos are static. Molecules are in constant <I>motion.</I> A molecular 
        design can help release your organization's pent up energy and speed 
        past inertia. Orbiting around his marketing cell, Frank and his team are 
        a moving target. Org is a lot less likely to devour moving targets. As 
        the saying goes, slow rabbits get shot first. In a molecular organizational 
        model, Frank and his team members are changing and adapting constantly, 
        so that what they do reflects the most current realities of internal and 
        external market factors. </P>
      <P >As a leader in motion, Frank is aware of Org and his cynical bent. Frank 
        also knows that team effort, strengthened by a sense of ownership and 
        the enthusiasm that comes with it, is dragon-proof. Proper alignment of 
        initiative and team players make genuine progress possible in spite of 
        the snoring coming from the custodial closet. </P>
      <P >To release the stored leadership energy in your organization and turn 
        it into increasingly productive and profitable kinetic leadership energy, 
        think structurally. In a molecular organization the rings of responsibility 
        are round and easily maneuvered. Power is handed off, shared, and reassigned 
        as the need arises.</P>

      <P >When you stop looking at your organization as a hierarchy and start 
        looking at it as a molecule, you can see how it becomes more dynamic and 
        responsive to internal and external changes. Org won't be able to 
        keep up with how fast the organization adjusts to fluctuations in the 
        internal and external marketplace. When people are engaged at the level 
        where they can contribute most, there's no stopping the motion. 
      </P>
      <P >As we strive to engage more people at every level of the enterprise 
        we try to make levels disappear; or at least become seamless. We want 
        the levels to cease functioning as a caste system between the haves and 
        have-nots. Change initiatives, new leadership skills, and professional 
        development programs will cease to be dragon food as Org begins to look 
        at the fast-moving, ever-changing organization as a playful environment, 
        every bit as much fun as the Honalee of his childhood. The more fun Org 
        has, the more likely he'll be to join the team and work for you 
        instead of against you.</P>
      <H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Leadership 
        development as a system</FONT></FONT></H3>
      <P CLASS="western"><BR>
      </P>
      <P >As you might have guessed, this book is not primarily about structuring 
        the organization to maximize traditional leadership opportunities for 
        everyone; although that helps. Instead, we deal more with the more urgent 
        challenge of leadership design. We seek to identify strengths and essential 
        natures within <I>everyone</I> in the organization so they can fully participate 
        with a leadership attitude, regardless of their positions. A systemic 
        approach to leadership is not only effective in enhancing individual leadership 
        performance in every nook and cranny of the organization, it is also provides 
        the foundation and the methods for building strong and effective leadership 
        <I>teams,</I> which are the core of any effective and dynamic organization<I>.</I></P>
      <P >Adopting a molecular model for your organization aligns structure with 
        the nature of getting things done. It also gives individuals a better 
        opportunity to contribute on those projects where their unique talents 
        and abilities are most appropriate. Not everyone's leadership style 
        is appropriate for every leadership challenge. All of the elements we're 
        describing are components of a systemic approach to leadership that includes 
        organizational structure, leadership style, and alignment of purpose with 
        unique talents and abilities.</P>
      <P> You've no doubt heard recommendations to make everyone in the 
        organization reapply for their job each year and prove they still deserve 
        it, and/or they're still qualified for it. That's how a molecular 
        organization works. Cells are formed around initiatives and tasks backed 
        out of initiatives. When the need for a specific initiative or task ceases 
        to exist, the cell ceases to exist. The people in the leadership team 
        executing that task or initiative are reassigned to new tasks and initiatives, 
        or absorbed into other cells that are expanding or otherwise changing 
        in composition. </P>
      <P> The strong, enduring, positive culture you want will stand the best 
        chance of surviving and thriving in spite of Org's appetite when 
        the activities people engage in are tied to a specific organizational 
        purpose. More than that, the achievement of organizational goals and objectives 
        will come much more swiftly and efficiently when the organization is in 
        motion, rather than stagnant. </P>

            of the organizational population, it's not likely to last &lsquo;til 
            morning. The dragon will only be tamed when solutions resonate with 
            the shared values and beliefs among members of the organizational 
            population. Org doesn't eat people, so he can't eat what's 
            in their hearts and minds. Internalized new ideas, beliefs, and principles 
            are safe from his nightly ravaging.</P>
        <LI>
          <P><B>Don't abuse your substance:</B> Doing more with the human 
            resources you have, rather than discarding them, makes far more financial 
            and operational sense than engaging in frenetic fire drills every 
            time things get shaky. The reasons that people become hesitant and 
            cynical are clear enough. So are the solutions to turn those attitudes 
            around. Do the things that will encourage people to embrace new information 
            and knowledge, not yawn and go to sleep. </P>
        <LI>
          <P><B>Fire the hierarchy:</B> Long live the molecule. Tethers to old 
            hierarchical organization charts must be loosened. If possible, severed. 
            Flat-footed notions of hierarchical leadership need to be replaced 
            with agile attitudes. This might sound like a pep rally, but the real 
            and practical need benefits of flexibility, agility, and unbounded 
            thinking will become increasingly evident as we move forward.</P>
        <LI>
          <P><B>Leadership is a system:</B> As we'll discuss more in Chapter 
            Two, leadership should not be synonymous with higher pay, more power, 
            or a corner office. Leadership is an attitude that needs to permeate 
            every fiber of your organization. Rather than portray leadership as 
            an exception for an anointed few, it must be acknowledged as an expectation 
            of everyone, regardless of their position. Your organizational culture 
            must consistently and unflaggingly support that notion. And keep it 
            out of Org's reach.</P>
      </UL>
      <P >Now you've been introduced to Org, and learned how he makes arbitrary 
        attempts at change and organizational improvement disappear. We move ahead 
        to deal with how old notions of leadership have kept Org well fed over 
        the years, while keeping most of the leadership potential in your organization 
        under lock and key. We'll also explore how new leadership concepts 
        can change Org into a vital and positive member of your team as they unleash 
        the captive leadership potential in your organization. </P>
