<P>The
character of your organization is the composite character of your
staff.  If 20 percent of the people in your organization do 80
percent of the work and vice versa, does that mean 80 percent of your
organizational population are lazy?  Are 80 percent of your people
lacking in virtuous character?  We don't think so.  It's
much more likely that 80 percent of the people in your organization
are not properly aligned with your expectations for, or the needs of,
your enterprise.  Alignment is the key.</P>
<P>The
greatest potential of your organization is tied directly to aligning
what your people do best with what your organization needs most. 
Choosing team members based on softball batting averages, golf and
bowling handicaps, cookie recipes, fashion choices, or other,
equally-inappropriate criterion is self-defeating behavior.  But, how
would you know any better?  Until you start asking the right
questions, you won't.</P>
<P>How
would your organization perform if <I>everyone</I> accepted
leadership responsibility?  How differently would your organization
behave if leadership were an <I>expectation </I>of everyone, not an

<I>exception</I> for the anointed few?  The most distinguishing
characteristic between thriving enterprises and struggling
enterprises is the presence and quality of leadership at all levels.</P>
<P>You'll
be happy to know that you have all the leadership potential needed in
your organization <I>right now</I> to increase performance,
productivity, and profits&mdash;and to sustain the increases. 
Unfortunately, the vast majority of your organization's
leadership potential is probably locked up behind the bars of
bureaucracy or staggering under the weight of organizational inertia.
 This doesn't happen by chance.  The cultural dragon you're
fighting feeds on old school notions about leadership that grew out
of a Napoleonic, hierarchical military organizational model.</P>
<P>Hierarchical
organizations are typically run by&hellip;well&hellip;little
Napoleons and Napoleonettes; especially at mid-organization level. 
They're cute, especially the way they prop their hands under
the lapels of their jackets; but they're not good leaders for
the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century.  It's not their fault.  The old
leadership school taught that organizations are made up of officers
and enlistees; the more powerful and the less powerful; superiors and
subordinates.  A hierarchical organizational design draws leadership
focus and energy away from problem solving and progressive thinking
by encouraging those climbing the organizational food chain to focus
instead on protecting their positions, perks, and territory. 

</P>
<P>Leadership
is a circle not a ladder.  Inverting this traditional pyramid of
institutionalized defensiveness and territoriality requires a
premeditated, purposeful, intentional, and methodical <I>leadership
system </I>that aligns what people do best with what organizations
need most.  The ComposiTeam&trade; Leadership System is designed to
do exactly that, and finishes what the movement for flattened
organizations, shared responsibility, and distributed leadership
responsibility started.  It does all this with remarkably
sophisticated three-step, simplicity:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Create a database
	that identifies the leadership styles and motivations of everyone in
	your organization.</P>
	<LI><P>Profile the jobs,
	tasks, projects, objectives, and initiatives your organization needs
	executed.</P>
	<LI><P>Match the <I>composite
	leadership profile</I> of a leadership team to the <I>initiative
	profile.</I></P>

</OL>
<P>With
that, the stage is set to focus everyone's unique talents and
abilities on making your organization thrive as never before.  Not by
luck; nor chance; nor edict from on high; but from a well-designed
and engineered leadership system that ties everyone in your
organization to the truth of the past, the irreplaceability of the
moment, and the promise of the future.  Without these things, much in
the way of time, energy, and resources will be wasted in an effort
that might take you someplace you had no intention of going, at a
price you had no intention of paying, and with more unintended than
intended consequences.</P>
<P>An
intentional, methodical, well engineered leadership system is your
best hope for taming your organizational dragon.  The leadership
system outlined in this book can unleash tremendous stored up
leadership potential in your organization.  The same knowledge that
will greatly diminish fear's power to hold people back will become a
system for building and sustaining effective working relationships.</P><!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
