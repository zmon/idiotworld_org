      <h1>Introduction </h1>
      <P> 
        <FONT COLOR="#333333">If you're buying <I>How to Live with an Idiot</I> 
        to throw across the room at your spouse, significant other, sibling, child, 
        parent, friend, coffee-counter clerk, co-worker, boss, or anyone else 
        you've determined is too clueless for words&#8212;&#8212;please, close 
        the book, put it back on the shelf (face out, if you don't mind), and 
        back away slowly. I don't want to be the author of the first literary 
        assault weapon. If you're hoping to discover a way to live with the significant 
        idiots in your life in a more tolerant and forgiving atmosphere, proceed 
        to the cash register. </FONT> </P>
      <P> 
        Reading this book may help you accomplish one or more of the following:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>You 
            could emerge with a kinder, gentler attitude toward clueless creatures
        <LI> Your 
            kinder, gentler attitude could give the clueless creature(s) in your 
            life incentive and tacit permission to become <I>less</I> clueless
        <LI>You 
            could discover that you're a clueless creature who shouldn't be pointing 
            fingers (oops)
        <LI>Your 
            new attitude could make you serenely unaffected by cluelessness, no 
            matter where it comes from
      </UL>
      <P> 
        <FONT COLOR="#333333">Many people tell me that living with idiots is frustrating 
        because clueless creatures don't <I>get it.</I> Idiots haven't a clue, 
        I'm told, as to what makes their partners happy. This brings two questions 
        to mind. Do we know what makes our significant idiots happy? I mean, <I>really</I> 
        know? Does our happiness depend on them? I mean, <I>really</I> depend 
        on them? Relationships are hard. Nothing in this book will make them easy. 
        </FONT> </P>
      <P> 
        <FONT COLOR="#333333">People have been trying to find a way to change 
        the <I>other</I> people in relationships for as long as eccentric inventors 
        have been trying to invent the perpetual motion machine. No progress to 
        report in either, as far as I know. We can't take other people's medicine 
        for them. I wish we <I>could</I> take the pills, swallow the syrup, do 
        the exercises, join a group, and go to therapy to make <I>them</I> treat 
        <I>us</I> the way we want to be treated. But, we can't. Not directly, 
        anyway.</FONT></P>
      <P> 
        <FONT COLOR="#333333">We can take the pills, swallow the syrup, do the 
        exercises, join a group, go to therapy, and make <I>ourselves</I> feel 
        better. When we feel better, everything feels better. Not perfect, but 
        <I>better</I>. The more okay we are with who we are, the more okay we 
        are with who everybody else is. </FONT> </P>
      <P> 
        <FONT COLOR="#333333">It sounds simple. It is and it's not. <I>How to 
        Live with an Idiot</I> is about emotionally enabling ourselves to feel 
        good in relationships; particularly relationships that haven't turned 
        out the way we hoped. The folks on the other side of those relationships 
        will need to decide what they're going to do and how they want to feel. 
        When we start to change, our spouses, significant others, siblings, children, 
        parents, friends, auto mechanics, co-workers, bosses, or whomever, might 
        like it. They might not. We must decide if&#8212;for us&#8212;it's worth 
        stirring the pot.</FONT></P>
      <P> 
        A friend of mine described the popularity of <I>How to Work for an Idiot: 
        Survive and Thrive without Killing Your Boss</I> (Career Press 2003) by 
        saying, &#8220;We all like our medicine to taste good.&#8221; This pithy 
        observation presumes that we feel the need to take medicine in the first 
        place. To this day, despite an avalanche of pop psychology and mood-management 
        medications, a psychologist's ability to change a light bulb still depends 
        on the light bulb's willingness to change.</P>
      <P> 
        The response from <I>How to Work for an Idiot</I> readers who <I>got it</I> 
        and reported positive changes in their sense of purpose, perspective, 
        fulfillment, and satisfaction at work indicates there are a lot of light 
        bulbs out there willing, and eager, to change. One woman, who spotted 
        the book in the Feltrinelli bookstore in Rome wrote to tell me she read 
        it twice in the first 48 hours after her purchase and had become a &#8220;&#8220;&hellip;less 
        harassed radiologist since reading your book.&#8221; She closed her email 
        with, &#8220;complimenti.&#8221;</P>
      <P> How many arguably clueless authors like me get a &#8220;complimenti?&#8221; 
        At last, my 12-step program for recovering idiots is beginning to pay 
        international dividends. While Se&ntilde;ora<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"> 
        </FONT>radiologist might have appreciated the sugar coating on my medicine, 
        I get a sense that she was sufficiently motivated to improve her working 
        conditions&#8212;sugar-coated or not.</P>
      <P> 
        The higher the motivation, the more discomfort we'll endure to achieve 
        a positive outcome. How willing and eager are <I>we</I> to change? This 
        medicine is intentionally light-hearted, but proven to work, if taken 
        properly. It seems every advertised diet pill or supplement disclaims, 
        &#8220;This product works best when combined with a change in eating habits 
        and exercise.&#8221; Duh. Any effort to live a rewarding life despite 
        idiot-ism requires a change in habits and attitude, as well as persistence 
        and infinite patience. Choose your own diet pill.</P>
      <P> 
        Nobody said hard work can't be fun and rewarding. How badly do you want 
        to be a &#8220;less harassed&#8221; <FONT COLOR="#333333">spouse, significant 
        other, sibling, child, parent, friend, coffee-counter clerk, co-worker, 
        boss, or person at-large? This could be your opportunity. Enjoy the medicine.</FONT></P>
