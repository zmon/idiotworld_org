      <p>&#8220;My name is John. I&#8217;m an idiot.&#8221; That&#8217;s how I 
        introduce myself at recovery meetings in the basement of the Methodist 
        Church on Thursday nights. I&#8217;m not just a garden-variety idiot, 
        I&#8217;m a <em>recovering</em> idiot. I&#8217;ve admitted my powerlessness; 
        that my life has become unmanageable; and it will take a Power greater 
        than me to overcome my cluelessness. </p>
      <p> We wanted to call our recovery group Idiots Anonymous out of respect 
        for the life transforming potential of traditional 12-step programs. However, 
        our idiotic antics make us anything but anonymous. Other people seem to 
        be aware of our idiotic thoughts and actions long before we realize there&#8217;s 
        anything wrong. So, we decided to call ourselves Idiots Exposed, or IE 
        for short.</p>
      <p> Since I&#8217;m your tour guide for this excursion into the workings 
        of the idiot mind, I&#8217;ll give you a peek inside of mine. Our mantra 
        at IE is, &#8220;Once an idiot, always an idiot.&#8221; We IEs never dare 
        to think we&#8217;re cured, completely out of the woods, or somehow immune 
        to the destructive potential of our idio-t-syncracies.</p>
      <p> At any given moment on any given day we have the ability to think right 
        thoughts and do right things. However, as idiots, it&#8217;s within our 
        essential natures to think and do dumb things without receiving mental, 
        on-screen error messages. Such is the nature of cluelessness. Our special 
        talent for thinking we&#8217;re doing smart things when the negative consequences 
        of doing dumb things are obvious to even a water buffalo is part of what 
        makes us idiots. As recovering idiots, we know we&#8217;re only one thought 
        away from a relapse. It&#8217;s sobering.</p>
      <p> Many people find the word &#8220;idiot&#8221; offensive. It&#8217;s 
        a term of endearment only to those of us who find inspiration in the strength 
        and honesty of our fellow recovering idiots. Yet, for so many to bristle 
        and recoil at the mere mention of the word, it must touch a nerve. Methinks 
        they protest a bit much. But, that would be judging on my part, a recovery 
        no-no.</p>
      <h2> The open hand</h2>
      <p> When tempted to commit a recovery no-no, I&#8217;ve learned to take 
        a moment, close my eyes, open my hand, release the thought, and let it 
        go. There&#8217;s a difference between <em>releasing</em> something and 
        letting it go. A slight-of-hand trick newcomers to recovery pick up is 
        to release a troubling thought, then snatch it back before it gets out 
        of reach. It&#8217;s frightening to say &#8220;good-bye&#8221; to dumb 
        thinking and behaviors that have became near and dear to us over the years.</p>
      <p> Only later in the recovery process, after much practice, can we truly 
        release a self-destructive or get even thought. As jittery and palm-perspiring 
        as it can make us, we will nevertheless develop the ability to serenely 
        watch it float away and dissipate. I made up a song for just such occasions, 
        sung to the holiday melody, Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow: 
      <p align="center">Oh, judging won&#8217;t make folks like you.<br />
        In fact, they might despise you.<br />
        Give yourself a chance to grow,<br />
        Let it go, let it go, let it go.</p>
      <h2 align="left"><br />
        Humor: it&#8217;s not just for breakfast anymore</h2>
      <p> I sing similar verses so often, on every topic from anger to denial, 
        I need only skip to the &#8220;let it go, let it go, let it go,&#8221; 
        for full affect. Seem trivial? There&#8217;s nothing trivial about humor 
        when you&#8217;re troubled or frustrated. If you&#8217;re not frustrated, 
        then you&#8217;ll appreciate the frolic. Open your hand. Let it go. Poof. 
        If you started laughing when you read the title of this book, the stage 
        is set to have some fun and, at the same time, do personal fine-tuning 
        as you deal with the significant idiot(s) in your life, be they your spouse, 
        civil partner, children, parents, in-laws, friends, clients, bosses, coworkers, 
        or all of the above.</p>
      <p> Sigmund Freud said that laughter is a release of energy. I&#8217;ll 
        go further and say that laughter releases toxic gases, which, if not released, 
        become increasingly combustible until downright ugly things begin to happen. 
        George Bernard Shaw wrote &#8220;Life does not cease to be funny when 
        someone dies, as it does not cease to be serious when people laugh.&#8221; 
      </p>
      <p> The humor therapy movement inspired by former The Saturday Review editor 
        Norman Cousins in his book <em>Anatomy of an Illness </em>makes a compelling 
        case for the importance of laughter in the healing process. If worry and 
        fretting can make us physically ill, I believe laughter will contribute 
        to emotional and physical healing. Laughing in and of itself does not 
        heal cancer any more than laughing in an idiot&#8217;s face will engender 
        a more congenial and copasetic relationship.</p>
      <p> Although it&#8217;s not easy to learn to laugh if you&#8217;ve had little 
        to laugh about, laughter nonetheless brings fresh perspective. The chicken 
        vs. egg, &#8220;You&#8217;re an idiot.&#8221; &#8220;No, you&#8217;re 
        an idiot,&#8221; discussion suggests that laughter might be as much an 
        <em>indicator</em> of a healthy perspective as it is the cause of a healthy 
        perspective. Generous amounts of laughter are essential to a healthy, 
        hopeful lifestyle&#8212;<em>as long as the first laugh is at our own expense.</em></p>
      <p> Laughing at my own idio-t-syncracies is the same as saying, &#8220;I 
        mean you no harm. Can&#8217;t we all just get along?&#8221; The same holds 
        true in relationships with significant idiots, parents, siblings, children, 
        friends, co-workers, bosses, and in-laws. By humor, I&#8217;m not talking 
        about gratuitous and pointless comedic comments like, &#8220;I have dental 
        floss and I&#8217;m not afraid to use it.&#8221; Finding humor in our 
        human condition is the cure for much of what ails us. Finding humor in 
        the suffering of others is not healthy, unless they fictionalize and dramatize 
        their suffering for the purpose of tickling our funny bones, like the 
        Three Stooges, in which case they are giving us the gift of laughter. 
        I don&#8217;t recall a time when I didn&#8217;t feel that humor was a 
        high calling.</p>
      <p> If no smile comes to your face when you see the title, <em>How to Live 
        with an Idiot</em>, I worry. Idiot is a term often born and expressed 
        in anger, but saying it aloud has a certain cleansing effect, especially 
        when part of a personal confession. Sometimes it takes getting a little 
        riled to launch a search for solutions. I&#8217;ve found that people who 
        laugh at the word &#8220;idiot&#8221; and gladly apply it to their own 
        circumstances are most open to solutions.</p>
      <p> Humorless people too often allow toxic gasses to compound until immense 
        pressure blows the lid off the container. In social, family, and romantic 
        relationships, we often think open or covert hostility will bring about 
        a satisfactory solution. But, how often do we think of giving the healing 
        power of humor a chance?</p>
      <p> People with perfect partners probably won&#8217;t purchase <em>How to 
        Live with an Idiot</em>. But, their perfect partners might give them a 
        copy as a self-deprecating gesture of good faith and humor. How cute and 
        clever it would be for a significant idiot to imitate the perfect partner 
        by giving this book as a gift? A healthy sense of humor is characteristic 
        of a well-balanced human being. We recovering idiots try to exercise our 
        funny bones every chance we get. It&#8217;s part of the healing.</p>
      <h2> Looking ahead</h2>
      <p> We idiots, recovering or not, have limited Random Access Memories. This 
        explains in part why we lack consciousness about how our words and deeds 
        affect other people. So, we make lists that can, like the 12 steps and 
        traditions we follow, bring a sense of order to our otherwise chaotic 
        lives.</p>
      <p> As you&#8217;ve already figured out, I&#8217;m setting the stage by 
        introducing you to the world of relationships through the eyes of an idiot. 
        It&#8217;s a perspective that might surprise you. But, don&#8217;t be 
        alarmed if the view from here begins to look vaguely familiar. There is 
        an inner idiot in all of us. Sometimes it&#8217;s small and insignificant. 
        Sometimes it&#8217;s huge and funny-looking. Sometimes it&#8217;s docile, 
        and sometimes ferocious. Sometimes it remains hidden in the far reaches 
        of our psyches. Sometimes it&#8217;s in our faces.</p>
      <p> We&#8217;re all probably closer to understanding and empathizing with 
        our significant idiots than we realize. As we become more familiar with 
        what the world looks like through the eyes of idiots, living with one 
        or more of them becomes easier. (Just because I&#8217;m a recovering idiot 
        doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t have to deal with other idiots in my 
        life.) As we get in touch with our inner idiots and apply the recovery 
        principles of Idiots Exposed, one or more of the following things will 
        happen:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>We will change our outlook and expectations of the idiots in our lives.</li>
        <li> Our significant idiots will respond positively to the new us with 
          agreeable attitudes and behaviors.</li>
        <li> Our significant idiots will respond negatively to the new us with 
          disagreeable attitudes and behaviors.</li>
        <li> Our changed outlook and expectations will render the idiot&#8217;s 
          disagreeable attitudes and behaviors powerless to upset us.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> If all we do is the first one, life will be much more pleasant. If number 
        two happens, sing Halleluiah. If numbers one and four happen, we&#8217;ll 
        probably never notice or care much if number two happens at all. The caveat 
        I mentioned in the introduction bears repeating: this book doesn&#8217;t 
        contain secret methods and techniques for changing the idiots in our lives. 
        It&#8217;s about reinventing ourselves, and thereby making us immune to 
        the frustrations of their idio-t-syncracies. As we say in the Methodist 
        Church basement on Thursday nights, &#8220;It&#8217;s not them, it&#8217;s 
        me.&#8221; If the idiots change as a result of what we do, it&#8217;s 
        the hand of our Higher Power at work, not us. </p>
      <p> Here&#8217;s my disclaimer: we should be so lucky. If we can manage 
        to get someone else to change in a positive way without first changing 
        our habits and attitudes, we should rush down to the 7-Eleven and buy 
        a lottery ticket because it&#8217;s our lucky day. It can happen. I won&#8217;t 
        say it can&#8217;t. Some people win the Lotto. But, the odds are more 
        in our favor if we go about it the old-fashioned way. </p>
      <p> Investing in our own personal growth virtually guarantees a jackpot, 
        if we&#8217;re willing to stick with it long enough. Even if we entice 
        our significant idiots to the edge of the healing waters, somebody has 
        to step in first. Ideally, all would step in together. But, waiting for 
        our significant idiots to take the leap before we do only holds back our 
        progress. Haven&#8217;t we waited long enough? Let&#8217;s get wet now.</p>
      <p> The road to serenity in idiot city begins in Chapter Three with an introduction 
        to Dr. John&#8217;s six categories of humanity. Each of us operates out 
        of one or more of the six categories. This new context takes the conversation 
        beyond simple idiot-ism in a hurry. Fret not. These are not clinical categories. 
        This book, after all, is called <em>How to Live with an Idiot</em>. The 
        medicine is intended to be as good-tasting as possible, while still containing 
        active ingredients.</p>
      <p> I&#8217;ve chosen to reference animals in some cases, so have a lint 
        roller handy. Attributing human attitudes and behaviors to animals and 
        other natural phenomena makes the attitudes and behaviors feel less threatening. 
        A warm, fuzzy truth is just as true as the cold, hard truth. That&#8217;s 
        why our furry friends get into the act. </p>
      <p> In the chapters ahead, taking a fresh peek at the world through the 
        eyes of an idiot, each of the six categories will be examined in the context 
        of seven (deadly) relational sins. Granted, every reader can probably 
        name a multitude of relational sins I don&#8217;t have on my list. Seven 
        is sort of a biblical number. Besides, why should I have more sins to 
        deal with than Stephen R. Covey has habits of highly successful people?</p>
      <p> Each relational sin is paired with a relational solution. I&#8217;d 
        never take anything away without offering something better to take its 
        place. Every chapter contains at least two sections called Keys to Living 
        with an Idiot. Many of the relational solutions are found in these sections. 
      </p>
      <h2> Keys to living with an idiot:</h2>
	  <dl>
        <dt>Practice patience. </dt>
<dd>We will recognize idiotic behavior in others before 
        they do; if they do at all. Frustration is usually self-induced. Take 
        a deep breath, count to ten, and wait it out. Open our hands and sing, 
        &#8220;let it go, let it go, let it go.&#8221; Idiots usually know not 
        what they do. Is intervening worth it? Will our becoming frustrated change 
        anything except our own blood pressure? Unless it&#8217;s important enough 
        to teach a pig to sing, let it go. To do list: Practice patience. </dd>
      <dt> Anticipate.</dt><dd> Forewarned is forearmed. Significant idiots are never far 
        from an annoying blunder. Anticipation avoids knee-jerk reactions. At 
        the first sign, try suggesting alternative behavior or take the softer 
        Socratic approach and say, &#8220;Remember what happened the last time 
        you (fill in the blank).&#8221; Anticipating can merely be a way to protect 
        ourselves. If the idiot has a habit of lighting the gas burner on the 
        stove with a match rather than fixing the pilot light, we can save our 
        own eyebrows with the duck and cover maneuver. To do list: Practice patience. 
        Anticipate.</dd>
      <dt> Calm ourselves.</dt><dd> If the title of this book brought a laugh, or even a 
        smirk, there is hope. If not, we may be experiencing pre-traumatic stress 
        disorder anticipating our significant idiot&#8217;s next blunder. We can 
        sit quietly, turn up the corners of our mouths in the Buddha smile, and 
        hold the smile while we breathe. Our diaphragms should expand with each 
        breath. Think &#8220;Idiot,&#8221; &#8220;Idiot,&#8221; &#8220;Idiot,&#8221; 
        with each breath exhale. Smiling like Buddha and exhaling the idiots from 
        our lives, we should be smiling for real at about the 12th &#8220;Idiot.&#8221; 
        To do list: Practice patience. Anticipate. Calm ourselves. </dd></dl>
      <h2> The initial argument</h2>
      <p> &#8220;This is nonsense, John,&#8221; says my fictitious alter-ego, 
        Shirley. </p>
      <p> I&#8217;m not Shirley&#8217;s therapist, even fictitiously. We&#8217;re 
        both regulars at Idiot&#8217;s Exposed, and engage each other in the typical 
        post-meeting chat on the sidewalk outside the Methodist Church. As IE 
        buddies, we have granted each other permission to speak freely. </p>
      <p> &#8220;What do you find so difficult to swallow?&#8221; I ask, implying 
        that the sugar coating on my medicine isn&#8217;t sweet enough.</p>
      <p> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t cause my (fill in the blank with spouse&#8217;s, 
        parents&#8217;, in-laws&#8217;, siblings&#8217;, or significant other&#8217;s) 
        misery,&#8221; she shoots back. &#8220;And I can&#8217;t fix them.&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t agree more,&#8221; I say. &#8220;Why would I, 
        of all people, suggest you&#8217;re responsible for another person&#8217;s 
        feelings?&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;Because my significant idiot is making my life miserable,&#8221; 
        Shirley explains. &#8220;And I already know you&#8217;re going to tell 
        me that my happiness is my responsibility.&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;No more entries please,&#8221; I say. &#8220;We have a winner.&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;So, I&#8217;m right?&#8221; </p>
      <p> &#8220;No,&#8221; I reply. &#8220;I mean, yes and no. You&#8217;re half 
        right, but you can&#8217;t have it both ways.&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;Which part can&#8217;t I have?&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;The part about them being the cause of your unhappiness.&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;Well,&#8221; she says indignantly. &#8220;They are.&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;Break this down with me,&#8221; I invite with calm deliberateness. 
        I&#8217;ve been stuck in this wicket before. &#8220;If you refuse to claim 
        responsibility for their unhappiness, which I agree you shouldn&#8217;t, 
        how can you pin responsibility for your unhappiness on them? Hm-m-m-m?&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;Simple,&#8221; Shirley retorts. &#8220;I&#8217;m right and they&#8217;re 
        wrong.&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;You&#8217;re in quicksand here,&#8221; I warn. &#8220;Stop wiggling 
        so hard.&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;Hold on, John,&#8221; she warns, raising her index finger for 
        emphasis. &#8220;If they would just think, say, and do what I tell them 
        to think, say, and do, my unhappiness would be over in a minute. Theirs 
        would be, too.&#8221;</p>
      <p> &#8220;It must be very frustrating when others refuse to acknowledge 
        that you know better,&#8221; I sympathize with all due sarcasm. But, it&#8217;s 
        too late. Shirley can&#8217;t hear me. She&#8217;s disappeared beneath 
        the quicksand. The conversation is over. I tried to warn her, but she 
        clung to her belief that the solution to another&#8217;s unhappiness was 
        the same as whatever would end hers. She clutched her belief all the way 
        down to wherever quicksand goes down to.</p>
      <p> Looking in the mirror and saying, &#8220;Glad I don&#8217;t look like 
        that.&#8221;</p>
      <p> Even if my example is too on the nose, shouldn&#8217;t we all be glad 
        we&#8217;re not like Shirley? We are more sensible than to think we actually 
        have that kind of power over others. Aren&#8217;t we? I admit it would 
        be nice if our significant idiots lived according to our rules, but trying 
        to pull that off by coercion, manipulation, and/or edict will only end 
        in frustration and resentment; our frustration and resentment.</p>
      <p> It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that I believed similar idiot-isms. I would 
        have denied having a hidden agenda all the way to the bottom of the quicksand 
        pit. I nearly did. I can appreciate the ire with which some readers will 
        respond when I suggest the only hope for their happiness and serenity 
        is shouldering the responsibility for change and to exercise tolerance 
        and empathy in relationships. Put another way, if you and I are going 
        to feel any better about our relationships, it won&#8217;t be because 
        somebody else changed.</p>
      <p> It would be great if our partners, parents, children, pets, bosses, 
        and bowling buddies suddenly became obsessed with shouldering responsibility 
        for their part in a healthy relationship. But, I don&#8217;t even bowl, 
        so what&#8217;s the chance of that? Suppose the God of our understanding 
        decides to issue an omnipotent order that causes our significant idiots 
        to be radically transformed before our very eyes. If we don&#8217;t do 
        the things to become changed creatures&#8212;ready, willing, and able 
        to accept and reciprocate respect, friendship, and love&#8212;the almighty 
        gesture will be wasted. Here&#8217;s some good news: even if the significant 
        idiots in our lives remain oblivious to our transformation, we&#8217;ll 
        still feel better about ourselves and our relationships. </p>
      <p> If idiots didn&#8217;t exist, would we create them?</p>
      <p> Not every significant other is an idiot and not every idiot is a significant 
        other. Idiots come in many forms and many sizes. Just because I&#8217;m 
        letting you examine the brain of a recovering idiot doesn&#8217;t mean 
        your significant idiot is going to look or act like me. Remember the essential 
        characteristic of idiot-ism is cluelessness. In most cases, cluelessness 
        is more of an annoyance and aggravation than a genuine threat to health 
        and well-being. But, it can strike without warning in devastating ways.</p>
      <p> Automobile accidents caused by applying make-up in traffic, dialing 
        a cellular telephone in traffic, or reaching into the back seat to rummage 
        through my briefcase for a phone number while on cruise control will all 
        cause temporary lapses in crucial awareness. Such lapses into idiot-ism 
        might only last a moment. But, if timed perfectly, suspending consciousness 
        about consequences can change lives forever.</p>
      <p> Otherwise innocuous idiots can be dangerous&#8212;especially temporary 
        idiots. Otherwise reasonable people occasionally believe they can get 
        away with something, &#8220;just this once.&#8221; I suspect you bought 
        this book because you feel as if you&#8217;re saddled with an eternal 
        idiot. Perhaps someone bought this book for you because he or she feels 
        you are saddled with an eternal idiot. Or, your significant idiot bought 
        you a copy as a clumsy-yet-endearing way of apologizing and making amends 
        for the grief you&#8217;ve suffered at his or her hands. Regardless of 
        how you got your hands on this book, I&#8217;ll go out on a limb here 
        and guess that you probably don&#8217;t feel your idiot problems are short 
        term.</p>
      <p> Good thinking. Whatever is causing cluelessness in our significant idiots 
        didn&#8217;t happen overnight. The attitude adaptations required to live 
        a happier and more fulfilling life with this nincompoop will also take 
        time, especially if we&#8217;re nincompoops, too. Get used to it. From 
        here on in, what applies to the idiots in front of us applies to the idiot 
        inside of us. We mustn&#8217;t start by misdiagnosing our parents, children, 
        friends, spouses, significant others, bosses, best friends, in-laws or 
        whoever is playing the role of primary idiot in our lives.</p>
      <p> Leaping into reality</p>
      <p> Although not much inspires significant idiots and significant idiots 
        do little to inspire others, an idiot is an idiot only relative to our 
        expectations. Some might not be idiots at all. Some might find the idiot&#8217;s 
        clueless behavior adorable, even entertaining. Others might find it disgusting 
        and irritating. The latter represents the primary audience for this book. 
        Like so many other things in life, it&#8217;s all relative&#8212;not only 
        the cluelessness, but how we feel about it, and how we choose to respond 
        to it.</p>
      <p> Thinking disorders we might not even be aware of having can turn reason 
        inside out. Our perception of reality can be distorted over time and we 
        run the risk of misinterpreting what we&#8217;re dealing with. For example, 
        pouring water on a grease fire is not a good idea. It only spreads the 
        grease and the fire. Smothering the flames is the proper technique. Save 
        the water for a wood or paper fire.</p>
      <p> Accepting reality as it truly is, and thereby properly diagnosing the 
        fire, is the only effective way to determine how to suppress it. Yet, 
        it is human nature to fight for our unique and often inaccurate interpretations 
        of reality instead of using the best techniques to fight fires that singe 
        our sensibilities. Sometimes the prospect of opening our eyes frightens 
        us, often to the point of sabotaging any effort to embark on a liberating 
        journey of personal growth, healing, and recovery. In other words, we 
        resist change.</p>
      <p> Childhood flashback: remember when you and some friends decided to take 
        that first terrifying leap off the high dive? You climbed the ladder imagining 
        yourself heroically diving, piercing the surface of the water, with the 
        others admiring. Then you looked down. If you were the one who summoned 
        the courage to go first, you experienced the grip of fear almost to the 
        point of blacking out as you leapt off the edge. The squeezing sensation 
        of fear was instantly followed by a rush of mind-clearing terror as you 
        had no choice but to accept reality. You were in mid-air. No going back.</p>
      <p> Once irrevocably committed to the act, the fear that resides mostly 
        in our imaginations, where we can embellish it, steep it, bring it to 
        a boil, and catastrophize it, vanishes. Imagined fear can&#8217;t exist 
        in the same space as real-time fear. Falling through the atmosphere, we&#8217;re 
        well aware of a potentially painful moment ahead. But, instead of ruminations 
        of catastrophe in our imaginations, our survival instincts are engaged. 
        We focus like a laser on doing whatever can be done in that moment to 
        bring about a happy ending.</p>
      <p> All of this happens in a matter of seconds that feel like a lifetime 
        because of the adrenaline turbo boost to the brain. In a splash, there 
        is a sudden temperature change and the diving bird becomes a fish. What 
        remarkably adaptive creatures we are. Even the clueless among us might 
        notice the droplets of water bounding skyward in contrasting motion to 
        the swoosh of bubbles we drag under the surface with us.</p>
      <p> As quickly as it started, it&#8217;s over. Relief and confidence replace 
        fear and terror. Bobbing back up to the surface, we veteran high divers 
        motion to more timid first-timers saying, &#8220;Come on. Jump. There&#8217;s 
        nothing to it.&#8221; Back on the platform, high above the water, the 
        others hesitate, even though a trusted person affirms that the leap is 
        not only survivable, but there is relief and exhilaration following the 
        experience. I&#8217;ve played both roles in my life; the bold one or the 
        timid and hesitant one, depending on the degree to which I allowed fear 
        to hold me in its icy grip.</p>
      <p> So it is when contemplating improvement in personal relationships; even 
        accepting that a relationship needs to be improved and/or can be. How 
        desperately do we want to feel better? How many friends who have found 
        greater happiness and fulfillment after taking the leap will it take to 
        convince us to take the plunge? How much evidence do we need before we 
        accept change can lead to a happier and more fulfilling life; idiots or 
        no idiots? </p>
      <p> When I&#8217;m faced with the daunting task of accepting a realistic 
        (not defensive) assessment of relational strife and my role in it, I invoke 
        the principles of idiot recovery and say to the other person, &#8220;You 
        might be right,&#8221; instead of automatically becoming defensive and 
        argumentative. That simple statement leaves the door open instead of slamming 
        it shut. That&#8217;s what learning to live with an idiot is all about; 
        creating opportunities filled with positive possibilities for us, and 
        for the significant idiots in our lives.</p>
      <p> Keys to living with an idiot:</p>
      <p> Learn to laugh. Not at other people&#8217;s expense or as a form of 
        self-abuse. Healthy laughter is a hedge against taking things too seriously. 
        Laughing at our own absurdities is like being the first off the high dive. 
        We prove to ourselves and our significant others that life is ultimately 
        harmless. If self-deprecating humor feels alien, if we&#8217;ve never 
        laughed at ourselves it&#8217;s time to start practicing. If we&#8217;re 
        too bound up in anger and resentment to yuk it up once in a while, there&#8217;s 
        relief waiting on the other side of the punch line. Learning to laugh 
        at our own idio-t-syncracies is a process we&#8217;ll explore together 
        throughout this book. To do list: Learn to laugh.</p>
      <p> Learn to leap. Like learning to laugh, learning to leap is a start. 
        Making a conscious choice to venture into unfamiliar territory can be 
        extremely intimidating and must be undertaken intentionally and intelligently 
        to avoid placing ourselves in greater turmoil. This medicine can be yucky, 
        at least at first. But, confessions to self and others plus reality checks 
        are key to unlocking the answers we always hoped we&#8217;d find. The 
        answers may not look the way we thought they would. Our perceptions of 
        relationships and the roles we play can be distorted. Pray for clarity. 
        To do list: Learn to laugh. Learn to leap.</p>
      <p> Meet and greet our inner idiots. Not the idiots we originally intended 
        to beat over the head with this book, but our inner idiots; the parts 
        of us that resonate in synchronous simpatico with the idiots in others. 
        First, we must locate the rascals, make positive ID, and then the chase 
        begins. These tricky characters, who have managed to avoid detection to 
        this point, will run even faster now, in a serpentine pattern. None of 
        the aforementioned self-deprecating laughter or boldness will be genuine 
        (and thereby helpful) until we admit and accept our role in whatever is 
        bothering us. To do list: Learn to laugh. Learn to leap. Meet and greet 
        our inner idiots.</p>
      <p> Chapter One summary</p>
      <p> This is a book about living with the significant idiots in our lives, 
        as told from the idiot&#8217;s point of view. Even as an enlightened, 
        recovering idiot, my essential cluelessness is like a torn fish net. Much 
        slips through. Take it in stride. Keep it in perspective. Humor is our 
        friend. We must learn to use it in healthy ways. </p>
      <p> Try to find a way to laugh at the sometimes misguided ways things get 
        handled. There isn&#8217;t much humor in a perfect relationship. See how 
        lucky we are? &#8220;Honey,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We might not be the 
        perfect couple. But, we&#8217;re always good for a laugh.&#8221; When 
        we&#8217;re close to perfection, just smile contentedly and breathe a 
        big sigh of relief. But, if you&#8217;re like me, there&#8217;s a barrel 
        of laughs hiding behind the bucket of tears we tend to cry when things 
        don&#8217;t go our way.</p>
      <p> Let us not cling to assumptions (like Shirley did) and let them pull 
        us down when we can open ourselves to new ideas. Be willing to refurbish 
        old ones. Practice patience. Let&#8217;s give ourselves a break from the 
        craziness that living with idiots can become. We can anticipate behavior 
        we know is likely to be repeated. It will save us the trouble of being 
        surprised and disappointed all over again. We can test ourselves to keep 
        track of where we&#8217;ve been and whether or not we&#8217;re making 
        strides in living a healthier existence with the significant idiots in 
        our lives.</p>
      <p> Laugh, leap, and meet our inner idiots. Once we begin to make laughter 
        a conscious and intentional part of our daily routines, it becomes easier 
        to keep a more realistic perspective. With a more realistic and less catastrophic 
        outlook, we will start to take risks we&#8217;ve never taken before. Venturing 
        into uncharted waters is never a stroll on the beach, but it will become 
        easier.</p>
      <p> As we more confidently step into healing waters, you-know-who might 
        do a cannonball right behind us. It will be child-like, noisy, and we&#8217;ll 
        end up drenched, but at least our idiot is in the water. If we connect 
        with that wee, small part of us that would also like to do a cannonball, 
        pressure begins to ease between us and the significant idiots in our lives.</p>
