      <p>Amoebas, co-beavers, and slugs&#8230;oh, my!&nbsp; If you're thinking 
        of buying How to Live with an Idiot to throw across the room at your spouse, 
        significant other, sibling, child, parent, friend, coffee-counter clerk, 
        co-worker, boss, or anyone else you've determined is too clueless for 
        words please, close the book, put it back on the shelf (face out, if you 
        don't mind), and back away slowly.&nbsp; Dr. John doesn't want to be the 
        author of the first literary assault weapon.&nbsp; If you're hoping to 
        discover a way to live with the significant idiots in your life in a more 
        tolerant and forgiving atmosphere, proceed to the check out line.</p>
      <p>Reading this new book could help you accomplish one or more of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> You could emerge with a kinder, gentler attitude toward clueless 
          creatures</li>
        <li> Your kinder, gentler attitude could give the clueless creature(s) 
          in your life incentive and tacit permission to become less clueless</li>
        <li> You could discover that you're a clueless creature who shouldn't 
          be pointing fingers (oops)</li>
        <li> Your new attitude could make you serenely unaffected by cluelessness, 
          no matter where it comes from</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Living with idiots is frustrating because clueless creatures don't get 
        it.&nbsp; Idiots haven't a clue, especially when it comes to what makes 
        their partners happy. &nbsp;This brings two questions to mind.&nbsp; Do 
        we really know what makes our significant idiots happy?&nbsp; Does our 
        happiness depend on them? &nbsp;Really depend on them?&nbsp; If you answered, 
        `no' to the first question, the threat level is moderate.&nbsp; We can 
        always learn.&nbsp; If you think your happiness depends on someone else, 
        red lights are flashing and buzzers are going off.&nbsp; The threat level 
        is extreme for a mental health meltdown.</p>
      <p>A reviewer described the popularity of Dr. John's How to Work for an 
        Idiot: Survive and Thrive without Killing Your Boss (Career Press 2003) 
        by saying, We all like our medicine to taste good.&nbsp; This pithy observation 
        presumes that we feel the need to take medicine in the first place.&nbsp; 
        Despite an avalanche of pop psychology publishing and mood-management 
        medications, a psychologist's ability to change a light bulb still depends 
        on the light bulb's willingness to change.&nbsp; How willing and eager 
        are we to change?&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We can't take other people's medicine for them.&nbsp; It would be nice 
        if we could take the pills, swallow the syrup, do the exercises, join 
        a group, and go to therapy to make them treat us the way we want to be 
        treated.&nbsp; But, we can't.&nbsp; Not directly, anyway.&nbsp; We can 
        take the pills, swallow the syrup, do the exercises, join a group, go 
        to therapy, and make ourselves feel better.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When we feel better, everything feels better.&nbsp; Not perfect, but 
        better.&nbsp; The more okay we are with who we are, the more okay we are 
        with who everybody else is.&nbsp; Why should we do all the work?&nbsp; 
        You don't think the idiots in your life are going to break a sweat to 
        make you fell better, do you?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>People have been trying to find a way to change the other people in relationships 
        for as long as eccentric inventors have been trying to invent the perpetual 
        motion machine.&nbsp; No progress to report in either.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; 
        Good news: The medicine in How to Live with an Idiot is intentionally 
        light-hearted, but proven to work, if taken properly.&nbsp; It doesn't 
        taste that bad, either.</p>
      <p>Are the significant idiots in your life amoebas, beavers, altruists, 
        garden slugs, jaguars, or whirling vortexes?&nbsp; A little of each?&nbsp; 
        Which category do you fall into Life Fountains or Black Holes?&nbsp; Nobody 
        said that Zen and the Art of Relationship Repair can't be fun and rewarding.&nbsp; 
        How badly do you want to develop a healthier, happier relationship with 
        your spouse, significant other, sibling, child, parent, friend, coffee-counter 
        clerk, co-worker, boss, or person at-large?&nbsp; How to Live with an 
        Idiot: Clueless Creatures and the People Who Love Them could be your opportunity.&nbsp; 
        Enjoy the medicine. </p>
