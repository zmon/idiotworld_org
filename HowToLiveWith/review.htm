STAFF WRITER </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><B>October
25, 2004 </B></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">We've
got idiot's guides to computers, investing, automobiles, massage,
child rearing, even breast-feeding and sex. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif">Now 
        there's an idiot's guide to living with an idiot. </FONT></FONT> </P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Does
your layabout husband clean the fish he's caught in the living room?
Does he forget (again) to walk the dog so it winds up fouling the
rug? Do terms like &quot;moron,&quot; &quot;slacker,&quot; &quot;imbecile&quot;
and &quot;dope&quot; find their way into conversations with your
significant other? </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">You're
probably living with an idiot, according to John Hoover. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;You
could get a divorce. Or you could get Guido from 'The Sopranos' to
come over and whack your idiot,&quot; cracks Hoover. &quot;But
divorce is no fun, and Guido's not cheap. And the relationship may be
worth working on.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Practical
solutions, Hoover said, can be found in his book, &quot;How to Live
With an Idiot: Clueless Creatures and the People Who Love Them,&quot;
(Career Press, $14.99). </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The
book is a fast, fun read, but its message is important. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Hoover
is a former marriage counselor with a Ph.D. in human behavior who now
consults, teaches and gives lectures on relationships. He said the
best tool for dealing with the idiots in our lives is a mirror. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;To
paraphrase Pogo,&quot; Hoover said in an interview from his Nashville
office, &quot;we have met the idiot, and he is us.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">If
we are contemptuous of spouses or other loved ones in our lives and
view them with disdain, the change must come first within ourselves,
according to Hoover. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;This
book doesn't contain secret methods and techniques for changing the
idiots in your life,&quot; he writes. &quot;It's about reinventing
yourself and thereby making you immune to the idio-t-syncracies. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;As
we say in the Methodist-church basement on Thursday nights: 'It's not
them, it's me.'&nbsp;&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Hoover,
who calls himself a &quot;recovering idiot,&quot; said the
&quot;distinctive characteristic of an idiot is cluelessness, a
person lacking the awareness of how his words and actions affect the
people around him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;Usually,
the behavior is innocuous. He never meant to do anyone any real
harm,&quot; said Hoover, who is also the author of &quot;How to Work
for an Idiot.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;Your
idiot is inconsiderate. And the thing to remember is, we all have an
inner idiot. There comes some point where each of us is clueless.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In
six years as a practicing marriage counselor in Orange County, Hoover
said, he often heard a wife declare, &quot;It makes me so mad when
Harry does this!&quot; He'd ask how long he's been doing it; &quot;she'd
say 20 years.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif">&quot;Expectation
is just resentment waiting to happen,&quot; Hoover said. &quot;She's
lived with Harry 20 years, yet she doesn't know herself as she lives
with Harry. You<I> can </I>send Harry to the garage to gut his fish,
but you <I>can't </I>act as if it doesn't bother you (when he does it
in the living room) and let resentment build and build. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;That's
like drinking a cup of poison and waiting for the other person to
die. The problem and solution are both within us.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Hoover
devotes a significant portion of his book to &quot;asking the animal
question.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;What
animal does your significant idiot remind you of, and would you have
one for a pet?&quot; Hoover writes. Evaluating spouses, siblings,
children, in-laws, friends and co-workers this way reveals at least
three things: </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Is
this other person likable in his present state? Is it truly his
behavior over time, or your accumulated bias, that led you to choose
his alter animal? Which of you is higher on the food chain, you or
the idiot? </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;The
animal you associate with other people says as much about you as it
does about them,&quot; Hoover writes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Changing
yourself and working to change the significant idiot in your life,
Hoover said, requires patience, realism, compromise, honesty and,
especially, humor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;Sigmund
Freud said laughter is a release of energy.,&quot; Hoover said. &quot;I
think it's a release of toxic gas, the kind that will cause you to
blow up if you keep it bottled up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&quot;The
subject matter I deal with humorously here is very serious. This
stuff ruins people's lives.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
