Just done Fri, Mar 26, full movie <A HREF="iwstream.html">iwstream.mov</A>  I think the quality can be improved.
The size is just about 28,000,000 bytes and it does stream.
<p>All of these are the same 47 seconds.

<p>untitled1.mov is basically no compression (as a benchmark) the remaining are variations on a couple of compressions, (lower video or lower audio, etc.) Let me know if any of these are acceptable (or worth it, you may have already done the best) Please refer to the file name as my compression schemes are the same.
