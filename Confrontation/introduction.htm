      <P>Sometimes controversial and always irreverent organizational leadership 
        author, lecturer, and consultant, John Hoover, PhD, has teamed up with 
        Athlon Publishing CEO, and leading expert in process leadership, Roger 
        DiSilvestro, to issue the toughest <I>in your face</I> challenge to executives, 
        managers, and supervisors in years:</P>
      <P> </P>
      <P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&#8220; Do you 
        have what it takes as a leader to hold people </P>
      <P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">accountable for 
        the performance they agreed to deliver?&#8221; </P>

      <P>Courage and/or an iron fist are not &ldquo;&hellip;what it takes&hellip;&rdquo; 
        to hold people accountable. Roaring like a lion and flashing a set of 
        brass knuckles are more likely to produce acute anxiety than actual accountability. 
        The good news: Confrontation doesn't necessarily lead to conflict, nor 
        does conflict lead to negative confrontation. By definition, confrontation 
        merely means to communicate face-to-face.</P>

      <P>Constructive confrontation is a structured, systematic approach that 
        <I>decreases</I> conflict and <I>increases</I> accountability by connecting 
        the dots between what people want and what organizations need. Constructive 
        confrontation reduces conflict in the same way it increases accountability; 
        through clear and well-articulated expectations, follow-up, and recognition. 
        Increased accountability with less conflict requires consistent, constructive 
        confrontation that establishes the course, makes course corrections, and 
        reaffirms the course. </P>

      <P>Confrontation is the weakest link in executive leadership, because it 
        is frequently mistaken for the tantrums of unskilled managers who reach 
        the end of their ropes and blow up at those around them, especially those 
        reporting to them. Two of the primary reasons for this behavior:</P>

      <OL>
        <LI>Confrontation is misunderstood, avoided, and not applied as soon, 
            or as often, as needed. 
        
        <LI>When it <I>is</I> applied, it's usually an expression of frustration 
            instead of skilled leadership.
        
      </OL>

      <P>There is nothing complicated about this roadmap for accountability. Supervisors, 
        managers, and executives can successfully hold their direct reports (and 
        themselves) accountable for their performance by using this three-step 
        cycle: </P>

        of Confrontation</B></FONT></P>
      Constructive confrontation is not a practice reserved for leaders 
      to apply to subordinates. Anyone, at any level, can, and should be encouraged 
      to, engage in constructive confrontation. The conditions are simple: (1) 
      There must be a covenant between the parties outlining expectations, methods, 
      and measures. (2) All parties must confront one another to ensure progress 
      and performance are what they should be. This means peer-to-peer confrontation 
      as well as team member to team leader confrontation. The rules and principles 
      are the same for everybody; the only difference being range of institutional 
      responsibility. (3) All parties to the covenant must celebrate the successful 
      completion of each designated step in the process. </P> 
      <P><B>Emotional Purpose</B></P>
      <P>The process of securing true commitment is based on emotional purpose. 
        Each team member must be able to clearly articulate his or her personal 
        and professional ambitions in real and certain terms and how his or her 
        current employment helps fulfill those ambitions. The supervisor, manager, 
        or executive must also disclose his or her emotional purpose, and relate 
        them to his or her role in the organization. The discussion of emotional 
        purpose helps team members internalize the context of the job. </P>
      <P><BR>
      </P>
      <P>Job functions are not typically tailored to suit what the individual 
        wants and needs. But, aligning the team member's wants and needs as closely 
        as possible to what the organization needs sets the stage for enthusiastic 
        and productive performance. Without this piece of the commitment conversation, 
        both team leader and team member might operate from assumptions that can 
        sabotage a working agreement. In terms of job motivation, emotional fulfillment 
        is every bit as important as money and prime real estate on which to park 
        a car. </P>
      <P><B>Commitment to One Another </B> </P>
      <P>The commitment stage of the process eliminates the mind-reading that 
        so many supervisors, managers, and executives expect will fill in the 
        gaps when their team members aren't adequately briefed. During the commitment 
        stage, team leader and team member discuss specific goals, the schedule 
        for reaching the goals, and the process for achievement. No much new in 
        that. However, the commitment consists of more than ethereal goals that 
        sound good in motivational meetings, or in the optimistic glow of goal 
        setting sessions or change management seminars. </P>
      <P>Team member and team leader must commit to one another to fulfill their 
        agreed-upon roles and responsibilities. One of the leader's responsibilities 
        is confrontation. But, team leaders must be willing to be confronted by 
        team members as well. If there is no clear, written, covenant between 
        team leader and team member, there is no basis for confrontation by anyone, 
        except by pulling rank.</P>
      <P><B>Team Leader/Team Member Covenant</B></P>
      <P>Formation of a covenant completes the first arc in a skilled leader's 
        circle of confrontation. If expectations are created by one party without 
        agreement from the other, if elements, the time table, process remain 
        ambiguous; if the terms of the commitment are not recorded and communicated, 
        there is no reason to expect compliance. Without a <I>written roadmap</I> 
        of expectations for the performance of individual team members, there 
        is no target to aim for, much less criteria for constructive confrontation. 
      </P>
      <P>If the commitment to action isn't cleansed of all ambiguity, the entire 
        agenda is likely to be derailed. Tasks and objectives must be specific, 
        concrete components individual team members can complete in a measurable 
        manner. And they must be written down. The circle of confrontation begins 
        with each team member's commitment to the required actions, in real time, 
        to achieve real results. The covenant between team member and team leader 
        must be realistic, complete, and meaningful before it can be enforceable.</P>
      <P > <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Confrontation</FONT></P>
      <P>Confrontation is course confirmation and, when needed, correction. In 
        business and organizational life, as in many other aspects of human behavior, 
        people set out to achieve predetermined goals and don't revisit the goal 
        until it has been achieved, not achieved, or the effort is abandoned along 
        the way. Any pilot or navigator knows that, although the aircraft of ship 
        departs for a specific destination, course corrections en route are essential 
        to reaching the destination. </P>
      <P>Individuals and those responsible for the performance of others must 
        check regularly for deviations from the course and make corrections as 
        necessary. Waiting until the deadline is too late. Once-per-year performance 
        reviews aren't nearly enough. Daily, weekly, and monthly constructive, 
        confrontation is a team leader's most fundamental responsibility to him- 
        or herself, team members, and the well-being of the entire organization. 
        Confrontation, as course correction, comes in a variety of packages, including:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI><B>Rewriting or reaffirming goals and expectations.</B> As progress 
            and performance are regularly monitored and evaluated, the original 
            goals might need to be re-evaluated. Internal or external changes 
            to the organization might call for modification of the original goals. 
            Other, unforeseen, influences might require adjustments.
        
      </OL>
      <OL START=2>
        <LI><B>Communicating what might have not been initially expressed and/or 
            understood.</B> Thanks to a continuous refinement process of monitoring 
            performance and progress, lack of adequate information or misunderstanding 
            need not rear their ugly heads. Things can't be said once and expected 
            to remain in the front of anyone's consciousness. Confrontation is 
            reminding, reminding, and reminding again.
        
      </OL>
      <OL START=3>
        <LI><B>Exposing intentional or unintentional misrepresentations.</B> 
          People can innocently commit to more than they're capable of delivering. 
          They can also <I>intentionally</I> misrepresent what they're capable 
            of delivering, figuring that no one will confront them on it later. 
            Windows can open for conflict to creep in when team leader or team 
            member intentionally misrepresents him- or herself during the commitment 
            stage. Consistent constructive confrontation deals with this issue 
            sooner rather than later, and provides everyone an opportunity to 
            come clean before too many opportunities are lost and too much damage 
            is done.
        
      </OL>
      <P>Confrontation, based on the covenant team leader and team member agreed 
        to, is constructive and non-threatening. It's not a personal attack, because 
        there is nothing personal about progress or lack of progress on a pre-determined 
        agenda. With a clear roadmap for progress, the discussion immediately 
        focuses on whether the team member is on course or not. If not, the conversation 
        can immediately segue into what is causing the disruption or disconnect, 
        and how it can best be addressed.</P>
      <P>When little or no clarity exists about expectations, roles, and responsibilities, 
        confrontation is almost always a negative and unproductive experience. 
        The commitment stage must be fully completed before the confrontation 
        stage can reach full value. Flexibility in course corrections or acquiring 
        new information is always helpful. But, &ldquo;changing the rules as we 
        go&rdquo; is never a confidence builder in team members' minds, and often 
        results in cynicism. When supervisors, managers, and executives don't 
        work the program, team members start bailing out. </P>
      <P > <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Celebration</FONT></P>
      <P><B>Celebration Sets the Tone</B></P>
      <P>Celebration helps keep confrontation <I>constructive.</I> If the only 
        ongoing dialogue a team leader offers a team member deals with course 
        correction and compensating for shortcomings, the long-term effect will 
        be dampening. Constant recognition of achievement, appropriate for the 
        size of the accomplishment, helps perk up the confrontation conversation.</P>
      <P><B>Celebration is Unfamiliar to Many </B> </P>
      <P>Armed with recognition for the team members' successes, the team leader 
        consistently and constructively confronts each team member as she or he 
        guides the team member's personal and professional growth&mdash;all of 
        which were included in the original covenant with an eye toward reaching 
        and exceeding personal and organizational goals. When it works, however, 
        many people are surprised and don't know what to do. For many, completely 
        meeting a challenge is a new experience. It part of the team leader's 
        responsibility to help team members learn to lighten up. Team leader and 
        team member alike must become good at celebrating, and not discount it 
        as frivolous or irresponsible behavior.</P>
      <P><B>It's the Little Things</B></P>
      <P>Celebration is the consistent and continuous reinforcement of the little 
        things and big things that make goal attainment possible; <I>especially</I> 
        the little things. Celebration starts with the smallest achievements upon 
        which the larger accomplishments are built. Just as monitoring progress 
        and performance are essential elements of the process, <I>recognizing</I> 
        successful completion of tasks and other process elements outlined in 
        the commitment stage is also critical to successful completion of the 
        circle of confrontation as a whole. </P>
      <P><B>Celebrate at Work and at Play</B></P>
      <P>Without celebration, commitment and confrontation are meaningless. But, 
        what should be celebrated? The circle of confrontation is based in part 
        on the achievement and acquisition of the things team members have identified 
        as the possessions, moments, and memories they seek most in their lives. 
        Life achievements outside the workplace need to be celebrated as much 
        as milestones in the internal process. The act of celebrating is an excellent 
        opportunity to reaffirm the connection between internal and external agendas, 
        and how they compliment each other.</P>
      <P><B>Celebration Keeps it Going </B> </P>
      <P>If commitment and constructive confrontation result in successful completion 
        of the covenant, celebration is essential to renew the cycle. The celebration 
        component of the constructive confrontation process provides fuel for 
        the continued effort. It marks the end of one cycle and beginning of another. 
      </P>
      <P>From celebration comes increased confidence and renewed commitment as 
        the cycle begins again. Each new cycle of success begins with a newly 
        energized person as a result of how well the team leader facilitated the 
        team member's growth and development throughout the process. The ultimate 
        cycle is fulfilled when the team member is able to step up and lead another 
        person through the process of commitment, confrontation, and celebration. 
        That's cause for <I>real</I> celebration.</P>
      <P > <FONT SIZE=4><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>The Art of Constructive 
        Confrontation:</B> The Need for this Book</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P>If enterprise leadership lacks a spine about anything, it's the willingness 
        to confront. A well-crafted covenant between team leaders and team members 
        is only as good as the team leader's commitment to support each team member 
        through consistent and constructive confrontation and celebration. To 
        give executives, managers, and supervisors the benefit of the doubt, no 
        one probably taught them how badly they are cheating themselves, their 
        direct reports, and their organizations as a whole, when they fail to 
        confront in a thoughtful, methodical, systematic, and strategic manner. 
      </P>
      <P>Although confrontation, in the form of coaching, encouragement, and accountability 
        is an essential tool in a team leader's skill set, the craft of constructive 
        confrontation is so rare that few have seen enough of it to imitate. It's 
        not taught in MBA programs. Typically, once goals and objectives are set 
        in most organizations, many team members and team leaders look the other 
        direction, aware at some level that there will be no follow through. If 
        team leaders fail to confrontation constructively, team members not only 
        have the opportunity to disconnect from their commitments, they have a 
        person to blame&mdash;the leader. </P>
      <P>In practical terms, it's universally accepted that organizational performance 
        suffers from lost productivity. Specifically, performance is lost as it 
        falls through the cracks between what organizations need people to do 
        and what actually gets done. That gap can only be bridged by constructive 
        confrontation. The Art of Constructive Confrontation is a common-sense 
        cycle of individual <I>and</I> organizational success that explodes myths 
        that would have us believe performance can be enhanced by:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Berating direct reports into submission to their leader's will
        
        <LI>Dangling diamond-crusted carrots in front of their faces
        
        <LI>Exposing them to a continuous stream of motivational propaganda
        
        <LI>Threatening to fire them
        
      </UL>
      <P>One of the core concepts supervisors, managers, and executives need to 
        learn is that <I>appropriate action drives right thinking,</I> not the 
        other way around. Training, education, hype, and/or fear-mongering won't 
        produce high-performance over time. Even when eliminating hype, false 
        promises, and fear-mongering and staying with positive practices like 
        training and education, the active follow-through of constructive confrontation 
        is still vital to genuine performance enhancement. Once the three-steps 
        of constructive confrontation are understood, the necessary instruction 
        and encouragement can be applied and measured evenly across the organization.</P>
