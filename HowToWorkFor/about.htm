<p>How to Work for an Idiot is the debris they scraped off the wall after a
management consultant&#8217;s head exploded.  For over two decades, Dr.
John Hoover wrote books on leadership, creativity, and organizational
performance.
 He traveled far and wide extolling the virtues of flattened
organizations, collaborative leadership, and shared responsibility in the
workplace.
 His clients welcomed him and nodded approvingly as he taught
the principles of teamwork and open communication.
 They politely waited
until he had finished and left the building before ignoring his advice.
</p>
<p align="left">Dr. John was unaware of what was about to happen as he facilitated 
  a two-day retreat with upper executives.
 As usual, he swallowed hard as the 
  COO said, &#8220;We need to sharpen our saw.&#8221;
 </p>
<p>He narrowly avoided gagging when CEO said, &#8220;We need to think out of
the box!&#8221;
</p><p>He appreciated their good intentions, but how many clich
s can one person
digest in a single lifetime?
 Nevertheless, Dr. John was a pro.
 He even
maintained his composure when the CFO said, &#8220;Who moved my
cheese?&#8221;
</p><p>The assembled executives burst into a spontaneous round of applause.
 The
CFO continued, &#8220;No.
 I&#8217;m trying to make a sandwich here.
 Who
moved my cheese?&#8221;
</p><p>Dr. John knelt at his Marriott bedside that night spent time on his
knees, praying for the strength to make it through the second day and
collect his check.
 His Higher Power gave him the will to arrive fresh
the following morning and embrace the executives&#8217; enthusiasm as
they endeavored to shift their paradigm and engender a culture of
enlightened growth and change.
</p><p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s continue where we left off yesterday,&#8221; Dr. John
encouraged.
 &#8220;Let&#8217;s think out of the box!&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Why do we want to do that?&#8221; the CEO spewed, as if he had
just bit into a sour pickle.
