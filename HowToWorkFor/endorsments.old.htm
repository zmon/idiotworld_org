      <h1>How to Work for an Idiot in the News</h1>
      <h2> Wall Street Journal/March 2004: </h2>
      <p>Dr. Hoover recommends admitting that you are ‘powerless’ over the jerks 
        in your life. Otherwise, ‘harboring all that resentment is like drinking 
        a cup of poison and waiting for the jerk to die’. </p>
      <h2>USA TODAY/March 2004: </h2>
      <p>Anyone who has to work should read How to Work for an Idiot. </p>
      <h2> New York Times/January 2004: </h2>
      <p>"There is no question that How to Work for an Idiot: How to Survive and 
        Thrive Without Killing Your Boss is a subversive book. People will pick 
        it up expecting a tasty blend of commiseration and advice.  They will 
        put it down thinking, to paraphrase the famous line from the cartoon character 
        Pogo, We have met the idiot, and he is us.    </p>
      <h2> FOX NEWS/Neil Cavuto/January 2004: </h2>
      <p>Dr. John’s How to Work for an Idiot is very funny stuff, with some stinging 
        jabs in there. </p>
      <h2> Weekend TODAY SHOW/Campbell Brown/January 2004 </h2>
      <p>How to Work for an Idiot contains a lot of humor, with plenty of good 
        information as well. </p>
      <h2> The Miami Herald/January 2004: </h2>
      <p>As amusing as his vignettes may be, the proffered advice is pretty sound 
        and includes solid steps for coping and surviving a daily dose of determined 
        and authoritative stupidity without committing any capital crimes. Hoover 
        closes with a bibliography that includes three of the author's own books, 
        so maybe he's not as much of an idiot as he claims to be. </p>
      <h2> Dallas Morning News January/2004: </h2>
      <p>[Dr. John Hoover] is creating a New Year's buzz with his just published 
        How to Work for an Idiot.  </p>
      <h2> Bloomberg Television/December 2003: </h2>
      <p>If you have the unhappy experience of working for someone you think is 
        a real jerk, Dr. John Hoover says there is hope. </p>
      <h2>Bloomberg Radio Network/December 2003: </h2>
      
        <p>Dr. John’s book about working for idiots is so cleverly disguised; 
          you might think you’re reading Norman Vincent Peale. </p>
        <h2> CNNfn/December 2003: </h2>
        <p>How to Work for an Idiot is an irreverent and realistic look at what 
          people must deal with every day at work. </p>
        <h2> Philadelphia Daily Local/December 2003: </h2>
        <p>Hoover, a self-acknowledged idiot boss himself in recovery, says American 
          workers should stop whining about their clueless bosses and learn to 
          make the most of it. </p>
        <h2> Minneapolis Star Tribune/December 2003: </h2>
        <p>There's more than humor in this fresh look at the perennial problem 
          of incompetent leadership at work. </p>
        <h2> Orlando Sentinel/December 2003: </h2>
        <p>Idiot bosses are so common, writes John Hoover, that he shortens the 
          term to I-Bosses in How to Work for an Idiot. </p>
